This is a placeholder file.

For a complete working extension, you'll need to add actual image files here:
- icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png for the extension icon
- noteicon1.png through noteicon8.png for the note icons

These can be any image files in PNG format of the appropriate sizes:
- Extension icons: 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 pixels
- Note icons: around 24x24 pixels would be ideal

You can create these icons using any image editor or download free icons from sites like:
- https://www.flaticon.com/
- https://material.io/resources/icons/
- https://fontawesome.com/icons
